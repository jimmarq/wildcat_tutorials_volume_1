== Prerequisites

1. A nintendo powerglove
2. A hand
3. A skateboard
4. Glasses
5. A can of awesome
6. Windows Operating System

== Instructions

IMPORTANT: Ollie in with your skateboard. Equip your powerglove by pulling it onto your hand with vengeance. Press buttons. Do a striking pose into the camera and very slightly adjust your glasses right before taking your can of awesome, cracking it open and taking a sip. Then say 'Delicous'.

=== Step 1: Press WIN + R.

NOTE: This is the key combination to open RUN where you can type in program names or CMD / Powershell commands on the fly.

=== Step 2: Type *powershell* -or- *cmd*, press enter.
NOTE: This will open a Command Line Interface to interact with which we will be using for the rest of this tutorial. You can press ctrl+c at any time while a command is running to cancel it and get input functionality again.

=== Step 3: Type *netstat*
TIP: Displays all the current connections.

=== Step 4: *netstat -a* 
TIP: Displays all the connections and listening ports.

=== Step 5: *netstat -e 1*
TIP: Displays ethernet statistics and will refresh every 1 second.

=== Step 6: *netstat -s*

Well by now you should be pretty used to netstat & the information it shows you. I hope you found this tutorial helpful and *The Last Jedi is the worst movie ever made IMO*.!

== Challenge

Apply what you have learned to make a quick and easy powershell script to monitor your network!

== Reflection

What type's of conditions could you make use of netstat?

Would netstat be useful to troubleshoot programatic networking issues?

Would netstat be effective to spot any unwanted / malicous connections on your network?
