= Refining Google Search for Information Gathering

Author: Kayleigh Hartland

== Intro

This tutorial will teach how to use Google search engine with search operators to tailor results and find desired information easier and quicker than using the general search engine.  For the purpose of this tutorial, you will pick a company or website to practice these techniques on.

== Prerequisites

* Working Computer
* Internet Connection

== Instructions

All of this will be done through an internet browser.  Open the browser of your choice and start with Google's home page.  A search operator is a string or character used to narrow a search.  This section will walk you through some useful search operators on Google.

. The 'site' search operator allows you to search a specific website for information.  Pick a random wesbite for this, and then pick a key word or phrase that would be useful to find on the website.
```
site:nmu.edu marijuana
```

. The 'inurl' search operator allows you to search for pages with a specific word or phrase in the url.  Choose a keyword to search with that could appear in a url. 
+
```
inurl: admin
```

. If you are looking for certain documents on a company's website, you can use the 'Filetype' operator to narrow the search.  In this case, pick a random company or website and use this operator to search for a certain file type on their website.  Replace 'domainname' with your choice.  You may also choose another file type.
+
```
site:domainname.com filetype:pdf
```
You can narrow this further if needed.  adding '-inurl:name.pdf', you can narrow the search to remove any results that include the named document.  For example, searching the below will look for PDF documents on NMU's website, but not show any results that include a PDF with 'handbook.pdf' as part of the document name:
+
```
site:nmu.edu filetype:pdf -inurl:handbook.pdf
```
. You can search for related websites or content.  Using 'related' will search for websites related or similar to your searched website.  Pick a random website.
+
```
related:te.com
```
This might help you find information on your company of choice, or even find similar companies.

. The plus (+) and minus (-) symbols can also be used to further your searches.  The plus operator will search for results that specifically include the word(s) after the plus symbol. 
+
```
admin +login
```
+

The minus operator will search for results that specifically do NOT include the word(s) after the minus symbol.
+
```
Marquette -University
```
See how the search results change without the specific removal of 'University'.
