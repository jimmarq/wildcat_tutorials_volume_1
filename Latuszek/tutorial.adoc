= Creating your first ever website!

Author: Matthew Latuszek

== Intro

Creating a webpage is simple enough for anyone to get creating very quickly.
By using tags, attributes and stylings your imagination is the limit!

== Prerequisites

* An Internet Browser
* Your favorite text editor (Sublime Text 3 Recommended)

== Setup

Let's get started!

. Create a folder for your learning, and create a text file in it. This can be named anything as long as it has a '.html' extension, though the general convention is to name your homepage 'index.html'.
. Create a file called 'styles.css' inside the folder as well, this is where we will make our website pretty!
. Open the '.html' file in your editor. Now the learning begins!
. Copy and paste this skeleton into your file.

```
<!-- The browser doesn't care about the stuff in these cool lines, this is a comment! -->
<html> <!-- This here is a tag! Tags look like <this> and there are lots of them! They all do different stuff. -->
  <head> <!-- Our <head> contains all the setup stuff for our site, title, meta data... -->
    <title>My site!</title>
  </head> <!-- Later we will put stylings right ^^^ here! -->

  <body> <!-- <body> is a very important tag, this is where all the meat of the site will go!

  </body> <!-- Right in here we will be adding a <div> tag and a <p> tag, we'll learn how to do that next.
</html>
```
== Tags

Let's talk about a few tags that are essential to web dev, as well as dissect a tag.

A tag has some important parts, the tag itself, its attributes, it's content, and it's end tag.
\/ Tag  \/ - Attributes - \/         \/ Content         \/ End of Tag
<div class="stretchFull" id="header">Wow this is a div!</div>

Some attributes are specific to a certain tag or type of tag.
- An <a> tag always has an 'href' attribute, which is where the tag links to.
--- ie. <a href="resources.html">Resources</a>
--- This will create a hyperlink with the text 'Resources'. Cool!

Some attributes are universal, and work on every tag.
- class
- id
- style

These are all attributes used for CSS. (Styling)

So what are the tags we'll use today?

- <div>"STUFFINHERE"</div> --- This tag is a 'divider' tag, it separates the different parts of our page.
- <p>"STUFFINHERE"</p> --- This tag is a 'paragraph', the most general tag for text.
- <h1>"STUFFINHERE"</h1> --- This is a header tag, there are actually 6, h1-h6, h stands for header, the numbers are different sizes, h1 being largest.

Not too bad hm?

== Editing the Site

Stick this in your head, this way we have a link to our styles.

```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css"></link>
```

Now inside your body, add a div tag.
```
<body>
  <div>

  </div>
</body>
```

Then add a header and paragraph inside that div!
```
<body>
  <div>
    <h1>This is my Site!</h1>
    <p>Here I can tell you all about it!</p>
  </div>
</body>
```

Check out your site so far by right clicking the .html file and 'open with' a internet browser, it should look pretty bland at this point but hey! That's stuff!

== Styling

Now let's customize this a little bit! This starts with some learning.

So remember those attributes from before? (id, class, style)
Let's learn what those mean!

- An id is used for styling something unique. Use these if it's the only thing you want styled that way on the page.
- A class allows you to style multiple elements using the same definitions. IE. class='red' on anything I want red. You can define multiple classes on a single tag.
- The 'style' attribute allows you to inline your styles, these are the last thing the browser checks, so styles put here won't be overridden.

So let's put an id of "intro" on our div, and then a class called "underline" on our h1.
```
<body>
  <div id="intro">
    <h1 class="underline">This is my Site!</h1>
    <p>Here I can tell you all about it!</p>
  </div>
</body>
```

Now let's go do something with this stuff. Open 'styles.css' and be ready to learn!

To style every single of a type of tag, you can define that using just the tags name.

```
div {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
```

To style an id, you use the name of the id attribute you set for the tag, with a '#' in front of it.

```
#header {
  height: 12vh;
  width: 100vw;
}
```

Lastly, a class is styled the same way as an id, but with a '.' in front of it.

```
.sticky {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0px;
}
```

So lets style some stuff!

```
#intro {
  background-color: blue;
}

.underline {
  text-decoration: underline;
}

p {
  color: white;
}

```

I recommend typing this in yourself as it'll help you learn and isn't much. Check out what this stuff does to your site!
Cool!!!

== Challenge

Try making a navbar, or a bigger site, with more pages.

There are many tutorials online for everything web development, especially intro level stuff.
UTILIZE GOOGLE, you wanna know how to make these things go side by side? Google.
You wanna make a navbar? Google.
Forgot how to make a hyperlink? Google.

Seriously, you can take this as far as you want. Google will be your guide!

== Reflection

You've just learned skills that put you ahead of the curve on HTML, pretty cool! The bigger picture here is that
this is what every web developer is currently doing. Googling and fiddling all day, we aren't super humans. That's Googles' job!
