= Basic Penetration Testing

Author: Matt Hoff

== Intro

Describe the goals and purpose of the tutorial here.
The goals and purpose of this exercise are to introduce the
reader to the world of penetration testing using an easy vulnerable
virtual machine. They will a few different tools inside kali to "boot2root"
the machine.


== Prerequisites

The "*" is a bulleted list.

* VirtualBox
* Kali Virtual Machine
* Basic Pentesting: 1 by Josiah Pierce from https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/basic-pentesting-1,216/[Vuln Hub]

== Instructions

Guide the person through the steps. Starting a line with a period is an automatically numbered list.

. In Virtualbox make sure that the network adapter for both of the VMs are set to "Host-only Adapter"
. In Virtualbox start the Kali Linux and the csec
. For the remainder of this lab we will ignore csec and use the Kali VM for the rest of this challenge

=== ???????
. Open a terminal cause this is where most of the attacks will take place
. First we have to find out csec's IP address
  .. We will be using a ARP reconnaissance tool called "netdiscover"
  .. Use the command *ifconfig* to find the IP address for the Kali VM and keep note of it.
  .. Run this command to find the IP address for the csec VM:

  netdiscover -i eth0 -r (Your IP Address and Subnet)



. Step three. Use "+" and the  backtick character to add additional command.

```
sudo su
```
