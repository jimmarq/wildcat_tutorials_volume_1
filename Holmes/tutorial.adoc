For the geeks among us: it's open source and powered by public-key cryptography." - Keybase

. Type the name or username of the person in which you would like to chat with.
. Start typing message under "Write a message".
. Attachments can be added using the paper-clip icon and emoji's with the smilie-face icon.

== Challenge: Send Encrypted Files

. Click on the "Folders" tab.
. Select "Display in Explorer".
. Accept the license terms and conditions. Click "Install" (may require administrative priveleges).
. Back under the "Folders" tab, Select either private or team under the folder options.
. After creating the folder, goto File Explorer > This PC. A new shared drive will appear.
. Any files placed in the shared folder will populate in your friends shared folder.

== Reflection

1. Emails sent from email client (ex. Gmail to Gmail) will have server to server encryption. An email sent from (ex. Gmail to Hotmail) will reside in plain text on the recipients email server. Can programs like Keybase help protect sensitive data?
2. Sending large files is not possible through email. By using an end-to-end encryption app such as Keybase, large files can be shared with the added benefit of end-to-end over server-to-server encryption. Can you trust (ex. Gmail) platforms to not use your data?
