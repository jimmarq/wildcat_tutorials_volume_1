= Simple Radio Frequency Pentration testing

Author: Christopher Moore

== Intro
	* Hacking into every day devices through non-standardized network administration of various electromagnetic frequencies 
	* There are many tutorials out there for RF modifications or Li-fi but this tutorial will just demonstrate the basics and definitions of whats going on for a noob.

== Prerequisites

	* VirtualBox
	* Kali Virtual Machine(recommended) Or Some other Linux distro
	* Choose one: YARD Stick One(cheapest), HackRF, or Ubertooth one, or RTL-SDL
	* A device within the range of non-lethal wavelength(i.e cell phone, radio, car) 
	* linux packages described later
	* Audacity

== Instructions

Guide the person through the steps. Starting a line with a period is an automatically numbered list.

. Step one(Getting to know the wavelengths and modulation).
	The thing to know is that you can go in depth how ever you feel but the only real background you need to know in basic radio hacking is Modulation

	in this image we see basically fluctuations in signals, our goal is to capture those packets and replicate them.
	This type of attack is known as replay attacks, which is the simpliest form and the hardest to accomplosh normally without some guide. It requires experimenting like a radio to tap into the frequency your looking for to channel out unwanted noise and focus only on the main target device wavelength.

. Step two.
	* what your going to need first is to run sudo apt-get update in your unix enviroment terminal
	* next you will need to search either from a provide github software like:
		```
		hackerRF sweeper https://github.com/pavsa/hackrf-spectrum-analyzer
		Linux (beta - only ubuntu tested):
		sudo apt install build-essential ant git libusb-1.0 libfftw3 libfftw3-dev openjdk-8-jdk
		git clone --depth=1 --recurse-submodules https://github.com/pavsa/hackrf-spectrum-analyzer.git
		cd hackrf-spectrum-analyzer/src/hackrf-sweep/
		make
		build/hackrf_sweep_spectrum_analyzer.sh 
		```
	* or GQRX-Reciever and Rfcat-transmitter
	* this will also requiure Audacity
	```
	sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:bladerf/bladerf
	sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:myriadrf/drivers
	sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:myriadrf/gnuradio
	sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:gqrx/gqrx-sdr
	sudo apt-get update
	```
	IMPORTANT: install in order as shown
	* next install the software
	```
	sudo apt-get install gqrx-sdr
	```
	* Optional Suggested Ubuntu packages	
	```
	sudo apt-get install libvolk1-bin volk_profile
	```
	
. Step three. Use "+" and the  backtick character to add additional command.
+
```
sudo su
```
. Step four. Use the following syntax to include screenshots or other images.

. Step five. Compile with the following command:

== Challenge

Provide some meaningful ways for the learner to apply their knowledge in a new way.

== Reflection

Provide some thought questions that help the learner make sense of how the tutorial fits in the bigger picture.
